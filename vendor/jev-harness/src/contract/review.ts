/**
 * One Jev round trip: four noul questions about one proposal.
 *
 * Transport is injected so tests and the mock mode never reach the network.
 * A provider error, timeout, or malformed reply yields `answers: null` with an
 * error string; nothing here defaults to "yes". Pure apart from the injected
 * transport and an injectable clock used only for latency bookkeeping.
 *
 * Extracted from TypeSafeAI/typesafe-playground `lib/harness/review.ts` at
 * 6fe5967dc020521a0731682b06c4d8eeeab95ffb and adapted to the hardened
 * contract: `JEV_MODEL` and `REVIEW_QUESTION_SET_VERSION` stay in ./types,
 * policy objects are frozen, and every request passes `validateReviewPayload`
 * before the transport sees it. Requests and real-source replies must use the
 * exact model pin; only explicitly labeled mock replies may report a mock model.
