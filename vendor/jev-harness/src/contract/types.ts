/**
 * Proposal-review harness — shared types.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript. No React, no fetch. A proposer suggests one action, Jev
 * answers four yes/no (noul) questions about it, and code decides. A verdict is
 * evidence about the proposal, never permission or authorization to act.
 *
 * Extracted from TypeSafeAI/typesafe-playground `lib/harness/types.ts`
 * (branch feat/proposal-review, commit 245167d), then hardened in this package.
 * Jev request payloads remain generic rather than importing a host API module.
